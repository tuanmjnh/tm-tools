/**
 * Preview engine boundary (roadmap Phase 5, R90).
 *
 * The preview never calls FFmpeg — playback is HTMLVideoElement + blobs
 * on both runtimes. What DOES differ per environment is how a stored
 * clip `src` becomes a playable URL and which media pipeline exists:
 *
 *  - `electron` engine: absolute paths served through the privileged
 *    `media://local` protocol, 540p proxy swap-in + stabilized renders
 *    from the local FFmpeg jobs (roadmap F-4/E-5) are real files.
 *  - `web` engine: sessions only reference blob:/data:/https: URLs
 *    created by `importWebFiles`; there is no local media pipeline, so
 *    proxy/stabilize features are off (their UI hides, their clip
 *    fields simply never appear).
 *
 * Everything the player needs to know about the runtime goes through
 * this small interface so a future engine (e.g. a WebCodecs canvas
 * compositor — the doc-era Phase 5 option, deliberately still a
 * follow-up) implements one contract instead of being special-cased
 * across player code.
