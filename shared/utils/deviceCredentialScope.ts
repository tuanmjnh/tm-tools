/**
 * Device credentials belong to one Hub, not to the app in general.
 *
 * A credential is a row in the issuing Hub's database. Pointing the app at a
 * different Hub (a local Supabase project, then Production) leaves a credential
 * behind that the new Hub has never seen, and sending it produces 401 on every
 * call — which the UI then reports as an expired session. The credential is not
 * corrupt; it is simply not this Hub's.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - a stored credential is only offered to the origin and app id it was
 *     issued for (`credentialBelongsTo`),
 *   - a mismatched credential is reported as such instead of sent,
 *   - clearing is allowed ONLY on a definitive rejection by the matching Hub
 *     (`error.deviceUnauthorized` / `error.deviceExpired`), never on a network
 *     error, a 5xx, or a scope/permission refusal.
